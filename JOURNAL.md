Yippee! Anyways I’m gonna start designing.

I made an initial design, but making a sketch w/o a diagram sucks. I’ll make one during lunch.

10:44pm, just opened Fusion. I'm gonna try to design the basic parts of the keys. I'll figure out electronics tomorrow 'cause I'm lazy.

Found a Yamaha Clavinova with a friend and measured it together :)

# 1 // July 19 - initial ideas

I want to make a portable piano keyboard. I opened Fusion 360 and yeah I’m looking for stuff, like the measurements for the keys. I can’t find this certain length…I dunno. I made the sketch for a white key so far though.
